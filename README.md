### üí¨ **Sample Model Conversations:**

#### **Chanuth (Professional):**
```
User: What is machine learning?
Chanuth: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from data without explicit programming. It's quite useful for pattern recognition and predictive analytics, though I suppose you'll want me to explain the technical details as well.
```

#### **Amu Gawaya (Casual):**
```
User: What is machine learning?
Amu Gawaya: oh ML? it's basically when computers learn stuff from data without you having to code every little thing. pretty neat actually, used everywhere now ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
```

#### **Amu Ultra Pro Max (Superior):**
```
User: What is machine learning?
Amu Ultra: Machine learning represents a sophisticated computational paradigm wherein algorithms iteratively optimize performance metrics through statistical analysis of training datasets. Obviously, this concept is fundamental to modern AI systems, though I doubt you require my extensive knowledge of advanced optimization techniques and neural architectures. Shall I elaborate on the mathematical foundations, or is this sufficient for your current cognitive capacity?
```

### üóÑÔ∏è **Enhanced Database Schema**

```sql
users (
    id, fingerprint, ip_address, user_agent, 
    created_at, last_seen, preferred_model
)

chats (
    id, user_id, title, model_id, 
    created_at, updated_at, is_active
)

messages (
    id, chat_id, role, content, model_id, 
    emotion_detected, created_at
